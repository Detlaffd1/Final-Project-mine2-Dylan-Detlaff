      <h2>From Rugby Roots to the Modern NFL</h2>
      <p>
        American football grew out of early versions of rugby and soccer played at U.S. colleges
        in the late 1800s. Over time, the rules changed to create a more organized and strategic game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Influential figures like Walter Camp helped shape important features such as the line of
        scrimmage, the system of downs, and the idea of set plays. These changes slowly created the
        sport we recognize today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional leagues eventually formed, and in 1920 the American Professional Football
        Association was founded. It was later renamed the National Football League (NFL), which
        became the most popular professional football league in the United States.
