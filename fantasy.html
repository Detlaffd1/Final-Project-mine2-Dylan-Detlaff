    <h2>What Is Fantasy Football?</h2>
    <p>
      Fantasy football lets fans act like team managers. You draft real NFL players onto your
      fantasy team and score points based on how they perform in actual games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each week, you set your lineup, make trades, and compete against friends or other players
      in your league. It’s a fun way to follow games, learn more about players, and stay
      engaged all season.

      <h2>Basic Fantasy Lineup Example</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>QB (Quarterback)</strong> – Passing yards and touchdowns.</li>
        <li><strong>RB (Running Back)</strong> – Rushing yards, rushing TDs, some receptions.</li>
        <li><strong>WR (Wide Receiver)</strong> – Receiving yards and touchdowns.</li>
        <li><strong>TE (Tight End)</strong> – Mix of blocking and catching passes.</li>
        <li><strong>K (Kicker)</strong> – Field goals and extra points.</li>
        <li><strong>D/ST (Defense/Special Teams)</strong> – Sacks, turnovers, and points allowed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Different leagues use different scoring systems, but the main idea is the same:
        pick players who consistently perform well and keep an eye on injuries and matchups.
