      <h2>How the Game Works</h2>
      <p>
        In American football, two teams compete to score more points by moving the ball into the
        opponent’s end zone. The offense tries to advance the ball, while the defense tries to stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The offense has four downs (plays) to move the ball at least ten yards. If they succeed, they
        earn a new set of downs. If they fail, they usually have to kick the ball to the other team.
      </p>

      <h3>Basic Scoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Touchdown</strong> – 6 points</li>
        <li><strong>Extra point kick</strong> – 1 point</li>
        <li><strong>Two-point conversion</strong> – 2 points</li>
        <li><strong>Field goal</strong> – 3 points</li>
        <li><strong>Safety</strong> – 2 points</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Main Positions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarterback (QB):</strong> Leads the offense, throws passes, or hands the ball off.</li>
        <li><strong>Running back (RB):</strong> Runs with the ball and catches short passes.</li>
        <li><strong>Wide receiver (WR):</strong> Specializes in catching passes.</li>
        <li><strong>Offensive line:</strong> Blocks to protect the QB and open spaces for runs.</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive players:</strong> Work to tackle, defend passes, and cause turnovers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Watching Your First Game?</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          If you’re new to football, try focusing on one thing at a time: follow the quarterback, see
          where the ball goes, and notice how many yards are needed for a first down. It gets easier
          each time you watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t have to understand every rule right away. The more you watch, the more natural
          the flow of the game will feel.
